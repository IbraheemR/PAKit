# PAKit
A tool to pack and unpack Starbound's .pak file format

It works by locating the asset_packer and asset_unpacker executables in your game files (or you can manually select them if they are not found).

Inspired by [resin.io](https://github.com/resin-io)'s Etcher SD Card formatter tool.

Probably terribly written, but it works (I hope).

Any spare [Garlic](https://garlicoin.io/) would be appreciated! GacWBGqzawm61FZdbTu2EbSSMKRC8i6QnZ
